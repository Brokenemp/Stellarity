## Notes
- ‚ùó Custom armor textures break with shaders. If you want to use shaders with the resource pack make sure to also download [CIT Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn).
- ‚ùï Mod packages of Stellarity have the resource pack built-in. This means you don't have to download the resource pack if you are using them rather than the datapack versions.
- üéµ The resource pack does not contain music for Stellarity, all tracks have been moved to the [Music Addon](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/stellarity-music-addon).
